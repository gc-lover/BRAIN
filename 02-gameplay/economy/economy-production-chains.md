  ↓
= 0 external costs
= Maximum profit margins
```

**Investment:** 500k-2M €$  
**ROI:** 6-12 months  
**Profit:** +200% vs buying materials

---

### Specialization

**Focus on ONE chain:**
- Master all recipes in chain
- Optimize production
- Build reputation
- Corner market segment

**Example: Cyber-Optics Specialist**
